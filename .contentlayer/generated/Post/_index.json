      "raw": "\nDo you want to get **threat intelligence data** about a malware, an IP or a domain? Do you want to get this kind of data from multiple sources at the same time using **a single API request**?\n\nYou are in the right place!\n\nIntel Owl is an Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT solution to get threat intelligence data about a specific file, an IP or a domain from a single API at scale. It integrates a number of analyzers available online and a lot of cutting-edge malware analysis tools. It is for everyone who needs a single point to query for info about a specific file or observable.\n\n### Features\n\n- Provides enrichment of Threat Intel for malware as well as observables (IP, Domain, URL, hash, etc).\n- This application is built to **scale out** and to **speed up the retrieval of threat info**.\n- Thanks to the official libraries [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl) and [go-intelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/go-intelowl), it can be integrated easily in your stack of security tools to automate common jobs usually performed, for instance, by SOC analysts manually.\n- Intel Owl is composed of:\n  - **analyzers** that can be run to either retrieve data from external sources (like VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB) or to generate intel from internally available tools (like Yara or Oletools)\n  - **connectors** that can be run to export data to external platforms (like MISP or OpenCTI)\n  - **visualizers** that can be run to create custom visualizations of analyzers results\n  - **playbooks** that are meant to make analysis easily repeatable\n- API REST written in Django and Python 3.9.\n- Built-in frontend client written in ReactJS, with **[certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui)**: provides features such as dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting new analysis, etc.\n\n### Documentation [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/intelowl/badge/?version=latest)](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\nWe try hard to keep our documentation well written, easy to understand and always updated.\nAll info about installation, usage, configuration and contribution can be found [here](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/)\n\n### Publications and Media\n\nTo know more about the project and its growth over time, you may be interested in reading [the official blog posts and/or videos about the project by clicking on this link](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html#publications-and-media)\n\n### Available services or analyzers\n\nYou can see the full list of all available analyzers in the [documentation](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#available-analyzers).\n\n| Type                                               | Analyzers Available                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inbuilt modules                                    | -

Do you want to get this kind of data from multiple sources at the same time using **a single API request**?\n\nYou are in the right place!\n\nIntel Owl is an Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT solution to get threat intelligence data about a specific file, an IP or a domain from a single API at scale. It integrates a number of analyzers available online and a lot of cutting-edge malware analysis tools. It is for everyone who needs a single point to query for info about a specific file or observable.\n\n### Features\n\n- Provides enrichment of Threat Intel for malware as well as observables (IP, Domain, URL, hash, etc).\n- This application is built to **scale out** and to **speed up the retrieval of threat info**.\n- Thanks to the official libraries [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl) and [go-intelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/go-intelowl), it can be integrated easily in your stack of security tools to automate common jobs usually performed, for instance, by SOC analysts manually.\n- Intel Owl is composed of:\n  - **analyzers** that can be run to either retrieve data from external sources (like VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB) or to generate intel from internally available tools (like Yara or Oletools)\n  - **connectors** that can be run to export data to external platforms (like MISP or OpenCTI)\n  - **visualizers** that can be run to create custom visualizations of analyzers results\n  - **playbooks** that are meant to make analysis easily repeatable\n- API REST written in Django and Python 3.9.\n- Built-in frontend client written in ReactJS, with **[certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui)**: provides features such as dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting new analysis, etc.\n\n### Documentation [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/intelowl/badge/?version=latest)](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\nWe try hard to keep our documentation well written, easy to understand and always updated.\nAll info about installation, usage, configuration and contribution can be found [here](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/)\n\n### Publications and Media\n\nTo know more about the project and its growth over time, you may be interested in reading [the official blog posts and/or videos about the project by clicking on this link](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html#publications-and-media)\n\n### Available services or analyzers\n\nYou can see the full list of all available analyzers in the [documentation](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#available-analyzers).\n\n| Type                                               | Analyzers Available                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inbuilt modules                                    | -

It integrates a number of analyzers available online and a lot of cutting-edge malware analysis tools. It is for everyone who needs a single point to query for info about a specific file or observable.\n\n### Features\n\n- Provides enrichment of Threat Intel for malware as well as observables (IP, Domain, URL, hash, etc).\n- This application is built to **scale out** and to **speed up the retrieval of threat info**.\n- Thanks to the official libraries [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl) and [go-intelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/go-intelowl), it can be integrated easily in your stack of security tools to automate common jobs usually performed, for instance, by SOC analysts manually.\n- Intel Owl is composed of:\n  - **analyzers** that can be run to either retrieve data from external sources (like VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB) or to generate intel from internally available tools (like Yara or Oletools)\n  - **connectors** that can be run to export data to external platforms (like MISP or OpenCTI)\n  - **visualizers** that can be run to create custom visualizations of analyzers results\n  - **playbooks** that are meant to make analysis easily repeatable\n- API REST written in Django and Python 3.9.\n- Built-in frontend client written in ReactJS, with **[certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui)**: provides features such as dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting new analysis, etc.\n\n### Documentation [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/intelowl/badge/?version=latest)](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\nWe try hard to keep our documentation well written, easy to understand and always updated.\nAll info about installation, usage, configuration and contribution can be found [here](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/)\n\n### Publications and Media\n\nTo know more about the project and its growth over time, you may be interested in reading [the official blog posts and/or videos about the project by clicking on this link](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html#publications-and-media)\n\n### Available services or analyzers\n\nYou can see the full list of all available analyzers in the [documentation](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#available-analyzers).\n\n| Type                                               | Analyzers Available                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inbuilt modules                                    | -

It integrates a number of analyzers available online and a lot of cutting-edge malware analysis tools. It is for everyone who needs a single point to query for info about a specific file or observable.\n\n### Features\n\n- Provides enrichment of Threat Intel for malware as well as observables (IP, Domain, URL, hash, etc).\n- This application is built to **scale out** and to **speed up the retrieval of threat info**.\n- Thanks to the official libraries [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl) and [go-intelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/go-intelowl), it can be integrated easily in your stack of security tools to automate common jobs usually performed, for instance, by SOC analysts manually.\n- Intel Owl is composed of:\n  - **analyzers** that can be run to either retrieve data from external sources (like VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB) or to generate intel from internally available tools (like Yara or Oletools)\n  - **connectors** that can be run to export data to external platforms (like MISP or OpenCTI)\n  - **visualizers** that can be run to create custom visualizations of analyzers results\n  - **playbooks** that are meant to make analysis easily repeatable\n- API REST written in Django and Python 3.9.\n- Built-in frontend client written in ReactJS, with **[certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui)**: provides features such as dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting new analysis, etc.\n\n### Documentation [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/intelowl/badge/?version=latest)](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\nWe try hard to keep our documentation well written, easy to understand and always updated.\nAll info about installation, usage, configuration and contribution can be found [here](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/)\n\n### Publications and Media\n\nTo know more about the project and its growth over time, you may be interested in reading [the official blog posts and/or videos about the project by clicking on this link](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html#publications-and-media)\n\n### Available services or analyzers\n\nYou can see the full list of all available analyzers in the [documentation](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#available-analyzers).\n\n| Type                                               | Analyzers Available                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inbuilt modules                                    | -
